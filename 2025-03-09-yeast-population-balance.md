title: Simplified simulation of yeast population growth
---

A simplified simulation of the growth a small population of yeast. The initial population is radomnly generated considering a normal distribution and a given average and standard deviation for the yeast cell weight. 

The default average weight and standard deviation of the yeast population were calculated based on experimental data made available in a paper by HADDAD & LINDEGREN (1953).
