title: Bioethanol production in Brazil
---

Brazil is one of the largest producers of fuel bioethanol in the world. In the past, the main sugar source for fuel ethanol was sugarcane, however, over the most recent years corn has steadily grown as an important complex sugar source for bioethanol production.

Fuel ethanol can be classified as either hydrous (95.1 ~ 96% ethanol) or anhydrous (at least 99.6% ethanol), depending on the amount of water in the final product. In Fig 1, the two side-by-side bar charts show the top 10 largest ethanol plants in terms of production capacity of anhydrous ethanol (left) and hydrous ethanol (right). Each bar represents a different plant site, but each colour represents a different company (or group).
