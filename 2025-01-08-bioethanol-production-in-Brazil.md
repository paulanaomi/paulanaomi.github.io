title: Bioethanol production in Brazil
---

Brazil is one of the largest producers of fuel bioethanol in the world. In the past, the main sugar source for fuel ethanol was sugarcane, however, over the most recent years corn has steadily grown as an important complex sugar source for bioethanol production.

Fuel ethanol can be classified as either hydrous (95.1 ~ 96% ethanol) or anhydrous (at least 99.6% ethanol), depending on the amount of water in the final product. In _Fig 1_, the two side-by-side bar charts show the top 10 largest ethanol plants in terms of production capacity of anhydrous ethanol (left) and hydrous ethanol (right) in 2022. Each bar represents a different plant site, but each colour represents a different company/group.

The orange hue bars indicate corn ethanol plants, while the green hue bars indicate sugarcane ethanol plants. In 2022, sugarcane plants made up 60% of the top 10 plants. In just two years, this number drops to 50%.

_Fig 2_ shows the top 10 plants in 2023. There is little change to the hydrous side of the chart when compared to the year before. However, on the anhydrous side, there is a new addition that entered at fourth place (FS Lucas do Rio Verde) in the ranking. The second largest plant (Inpasa - Dourados) also gained in production capacity from the year before. Both plants mentioned are corn ethanol plants and contribute to an overall impression of growth in corn ethanol over the last few years.

_Fig 3_ containis the same ranking for 2024 and shows considerable change from the year before. Notably, the plant that ranked in first in 2023 and 2024 (Inpasa - Sinop) doubled in anhydrous capactiy in just one year. The plants ranking in second (Inpasa - Dourados) and third (FS Bio - Sorriso) also gained in capacity. Also, the plant that ranked at seventh the year (FS - Lucas do Rio Verde) before moved up 2 places to fifth place. The top half of the 10 largest plants in anhydrous capacity are now completely made up of corn ethanol plants. As for the hydrous ethanol side, only one plant in the top 5 represents a sugarcane plant (São Martinho - Boa Vista). 

The changes in the ranking can be more easily observed in the ribbon charts below. The ribbon charts show how the composition of the ranking evolved over the past 5 years. A smaller number of plants in the ranking per year was considered for these graphs (5 as opposed to 10 in the bar charts from before). Different colour palettes were used, there isn't a clear colour code to seperate the different feedstocks used in the ribbon charts.
